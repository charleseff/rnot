Rnot
=======
Rnot is a cross-platform note-taking app written in Ruby, designed for extremely quick notetaking and SimpleNote integration, which allows for syncing across the devices.  Influence for Rnot came directly from Notational Velocity, and in fact was largely created because Notational Velocity does not work on on Linux.

## Installation
RNot is recommended to be run with RVM and Ruby 1.9.2.  Once installed, simply run `bundle`, and then run `rnot.rb` in the main directory.
